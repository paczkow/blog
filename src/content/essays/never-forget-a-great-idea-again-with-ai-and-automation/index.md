Have you ever noticed that your best ideas often come when you least expect them? Maybe while you’re out for a run, in the middle of a gym session, or even when you’re deeply focused on a different task at work. These creative moments seem to appear out of nowhere — often at the most inconvenient times.

For a long time, I struggled with what to do in these situations.

I tried to write my thoughts down right away, but sometimes there were just too many at once, or my ideas were too long to capture quickly.
As a result, I would forget some of them, or get frustrated when I had to interrupt my current work just to take notes. However everything has changes when AI came in.

## Use voice to capture ideas instantly

OpenAI Whisper effortlessly turns voice notes into text — just connect it to your system, and it takes care of everything.

I was looking for a seamless way to capture my thoughts on my Apple devices and send them to TickTick, the to-do app I'm currently using. I utilized iOS Shortcuts, which allows me to create a set of actions using blocks.

<!--TODO: wyjaśnij co to API endpoint oraz API Token -->

To convert voice to text, simply add the "Get Contents of URL" action to the flow to send the request.

Initially, I started by putting everything into iOS Shortcuts. It was quite simple to set up — just get the OpenAPI Token, send the request to convert voice to text, wait for the answer, send another request to LLM transform to text into task, wait for the answer (x2) and send to TickTick (At this point, you can do whatever you want with the text, run another Shortcut, or pass it into a different application).

I used the following prompt to convert text into task.

```prompt
sssss
```

I wanted to keep it in JSON format what is really convienet form to grap information into further steps.

It’s a type of synchronous approach: send the request, wait, and receive the response in the same place you sent the request. It’s really convenient and simple; you control the whole flow in one place, and you can adjust and tweak the output in the next steps.

Despite all these advantages, time was a major blocker for me. When trying to capture voice on the Apple Watch, it took ages. That’s why I decided to make it asynchronous using [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

## Async Solution - iOS Shortcuts + n8n

One of my primary assumptions was to be able to quickly capture multiple, independent thoughts. In the previous synchronous approach, I had to wait for each flow to complete, which involved waiting for the request to the OpenAI API. Such a waste of time!

Instead, I just capture the voice, create a file, send the request, and forget about it. The rest is processed in the background, asynchronously, allowing me to record the next thought.

To allow uploads from different places, I used a [Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node that confirms the audio file upload in the first step. The Webhook offers an endpoint URL where you can upload your file to trigger the workflow. I integrated this functionality with "iOS Shortcuts" using the "Get Contents of URL" action, similar to my previous automation.

This automation utilizes an [AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node with a custom prompt for creating a task from the transcript. I also ensured that the output is formatted to align with the TickTick API by using the [Structured Output Parse](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/).

However, this asynchronous approach has a few caveats.

I have less control over what’s happening; I can't simply manage it in Shortcuts. Also, in n8n, I have to control the entire process, including the endpoint (TickTick in my case). In the previous approach, I just received the text, which I could use in further steps.

Regarding error handling in the asynchronous approach, I need to inform myself about potential workflow problems asynchronously. I did this using Slack with a chatbot.

Time is a precious gift that you can't get back, so don't waste it on repetitive tasks - automate them.

AI and tools like n8n make creating an "army of robots" much easier than it was 2-3 years ago. Additionally, automation is no longer just nice-to-have; it’s a valuable skill that can make you stand out in the job market.
